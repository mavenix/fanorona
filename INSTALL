Fanorona doesn't have to be compiled/installed to run
but you must install dependencies before, on Debian run:
$ sudo apt-get install python python-numeric python-pygame

To run excute the following in this directory:
$ PYTHONPATH=lib/ ./fanorona

to play against a simple program
$ PYTHONPATH=lib/ ./fanorona --single

to specify the timeout in second
$ PYTHONPATH=lib/ ./fanorona --timeout 120
